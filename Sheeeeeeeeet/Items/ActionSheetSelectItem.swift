 Select items are used to let the user select one or several
 items in an action sheet. Unlike the `ActionSheetItem` type,
 this type has an `isSelected` state, a selected icon and an
 extended appearance.
 
 Use this class when you prefer the default `ActionSheetItem`
 item behavior but also want to highlight currently selected
 items in a sheet. A select items, by default, dismisses the
 action sheet when it's tapped, much like the base item.
 
 You can also use any of the subclasses instead of this type:
 
 * `ActionSheetSingleSelectItem` automatically deselects any
 other single select items in the same group. This means you
 don't have to implement this behavior.
 * `ActionSheetMultiSelectItem` can be used together with an
 `ActionSheetMultiSelectToggleItem`, which can automatically
 select/deselect all multi select items in the same group.
 
 The subclasses also have their own extended appearances, so
 you can customize them. These appearances inherit this base
 appearance, however.
 
 The `group` property is not used by this item, although you
 can use it in your custom code. It is, however, used by the
 single select item and the multi select item toggler.
