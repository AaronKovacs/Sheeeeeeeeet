 Select items are used to let the user select one or several
 items in an action sheet. The default mode is single select,
 which means that the action sheet will be dismissed when an
 item is selected. If you want to use multi select, just set
 the `tapBehavior` property to `none` for every item and add
 a button to the action sheet, that applies any changes made
 by the user.
