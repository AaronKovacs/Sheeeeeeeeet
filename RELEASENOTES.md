# Release Notes

These release notes are so far manually created. They should probably be an auto
generated aggregate of all new commits in the version tag.


## 0.8.0

Breaking changes! The toggle item has been a strange part of Sheeeeeeeeet. It is
basically a select item with individual styling, which is easy to customize with
the built-in appearance. We have therefore decided to remove this item type from
`Sheeeeeeeeet`, with hopes that it will make the api more obvious.

The `ActionSheetSingleSelectItem` tap behavior has been changed to use `.dismiss`.
This makes the behavior consistent with the standard select item. This means you
have to manually set the tap behavior `.none` whenever you need that behavior.

We have added a `ActionSheetSingleSelectItemAppearance` class to the library and
added a new `singleSelectItem` property to the appearance class.



## 0.7.1

Select items can now have a separate select tint color for the left icon.



## 0.7.0

We have added a subtitle to the section title item and clarified the examples by
moving action sheets into their own separate classes.
